    <h2 class="history">Bichon Frise History!</h2>
      <p>Before we meet the puppy, we need to know about their history. 
        <br>Why there is a dog breed named Bichon Frise?
        <br>Where are they from?
      </p>
      
      <p class="history">
           The Bichon Frise (pronounced BEE-shawn FREE-say; the plural is Bichons Frises) is a cheerful, 
           small dog breed with a love of mischief and a lot of love to give. 
           <br>With their black eyes and fluffy white coat, the Bichon looks almost like a child’s toy. 
           <br>Bred specifically to be a companion, the Bichon Frise is a wonderfully affectionate dog. 
           <span id="dots">...</span>
           <span id="more">   
           <br>Because his job was to entertain, his nifty repertoire of tricks made him an ideal circus dog. 
           <br>Today, though, he's more often found entertaining his people at home. 
           <br>The earliest records of the Bichon Frise breed date from the 14th century, when French sailors brought the dogs home from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands. 
           <br>It's thought that Bichon Frise dogs had been taken there by traders who used the Phoenician trade route, and that the Bichon Frise originally developed in Italy.

    <h2 class="description">Bichon Frise Description!</h2>
      <p>Dog can grow up and gain weight in many different ways. 
        <br>Before they become our family member, we need to know whether they are suitable for the family or can we give them a good care?</p>
      <p class="description">Appearance:<br>
         The Bichon Frise is a small dog that weighs approximately 5–10 kg (10–20 lbs) and stands 23–30 cm (9–12 in) at the withers, but slightly larger dogs are not uncommon. 
        <br>The skull is slightly rounded and the muzzle is not pointy. The tail is groomed to be long and curly and is carried over the back. 
        <br>It has a black nose and dark round eyes; its white hair consists of a curly, dense coat with little shedding (much like a poodle in this respect), although many of the breed do tend to have less curly hair than others. 
        <br>A small amount of buff, cream, or apricot colour may be seen around its ears, snout, paws or body, but normally these colours do not exceed 10% of its body.  
        <br>FCI/AKC Standard coat colour is pure white; other colours such as apricot or grey and brown are not recognised. A white coat is preferred in the show ring. 
        <br>The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body, and the ears and tail are natural (not docked or cropped). 
        <br>The coat is trimmed often to make the hair seem like an even length. Bichon Frises have a medium-high intelligence.
        <span id="desDots">...</span>
        <span id="desMore">
        <br><br>Health concerns:<br>
          Bichon Frises are prone to scratching and chewing on themselves in the summer because of the warm and moist air, which commonly results in serious skin conditions. 
          <br>They are comparatively hypoallergenic, but they themselves suffer from allergies to fleas, ticks, chemicals, pollen, dust, etc. 
          <br>Loose knee joints, ear infections, cataracts, diabetes, and heart disease are also common. Bichons are also prone to liver shunts. 
          <br>These often go undetected until later in life, leading to complications that cannot be addressed, and therefore liver failure. 
          <br>Bichons who are underweight, runts of the litter, or have negative reactions to foods high in protein are more likely to be suffering from a shunt. When detected early, shunt often can be corrected through surgery. 
          <br>However, the later in life the shunt is detected, the lower the likelihood of surgery being successful. 
          <br>Shunts can be kept under control through special low-protein diets and through medications to support liver function, help flush toxins that build up in the kidneys and liver, and control seizures that often occur as a symptom of the shunt. 
          <br>Without surgery, Bichons with shunts on average live to be 4–6 years old. Other symptoms include dark urine, lethargy, loss of appetite, and increased thirst. 
          <br>Seizures come in all forms; episodes of seizures can begin early in life but may go undetected. Early seizures can appear as a hypnotic state or an episode of vertigo.
        <br><br>Grooming:<br>
          Bichons should be brushed at least two or three times a week, but every day is best. They need a bath and a clipping at least once a month. 
          <br>Owners who show their Bichons learn to do this, but most pet owners take their Bichon to the groomer every four to six weeks. 
          <br>The Bichon is considered to be relatively hypoallergenic, as the breed sheds very little because the shed hair is caught up in the undercoat. 
          <br>That shed hair has to be brushed out to prevent mats from forming. As with all breeds, the Bichon’s nails should be trimmed regularly as well.

      <p class="ques">General Questions and Answers:<br>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li class="list1">Is Bichon frise a toy dog breed?</li>
        <dd>Yes, Bichon frise is a toy dog breed.</dd>
        <li class="list1">How big will Bichon grow?</li>
        <dd>Bichons are naturally a small breed, standing up to around 28cm tall at the withers at a maximum, and weighing up to around 5kg. 
          They’re petite and quite delicate, although also quite feisty!</dd>
        <li class="list1">Dose it cost a lot to rearing them?</li>
        <dd>They’re around the middle of the pack in terms of the average costs to keep dogs of the breed too, and their small size means 
          they only need the smaller versions of things, which tend to be cheaper!</dd>
        <li class="list1">Does Bichon has long live?</li>
        <dd>The breed as a whole tends to be healthy and long lived
          Small dog breeds usually live for rather longer than their larger counterparts, and the Bichon is, across the board, one of the longer-lived small breeds too.</dd>
        <li class="list1">What is average of Bichon's lifespans?</li>
        <dd>Their average lifespans range from around 12-15 years when appropriately fed and cared for, and it is not really unusual for dogs of the breed to live well into their late teens either.</dd>
        <li class="list1">Is Bichon has healthy issues?</li>
        <dd>Like all dog breeds, there are a few specific hereditary health issues that tend to present in Bichons more commonly than most other breeds.</dd>
        <li class="list1">Does Bichon need grooming frequent?</li>
        <dd>They do need a lot of grooming because the Bichon coat doesn’t shed much of the fur it loses, they need regular brushing and grooming to remove this for them, and to keep their skin and coat in good condition.</dd>
        <li class="list1">Is Bichon a smart dog?</li>
        <dd>Bichons are middle of the road in terms of intelligence when it comes to canine intelligence, and they are perfectly capable of learning and executing a reasonable number of training commands.</dd>
        <li class="list1">Does Bichon good for allergy sufferers?</li>
        <dd>White and distinctive in terms of its texture, which is tightly curled and tends to grow out sideways rather than straight down! 
          <br>Because the coat is comprised of tight coils of fur, when shed fur is lost, it becomes tangled up in the rest of the coat and is not dropped prolifically around the home.
          <br>This means that it spreads less dander around, and in turn, may mean that the Bichon won’t be as likely to trigger allergies in people sensitive to dogs.
          <br>By no means all or most Bichons suffer from allergies, but this is something to bear in mind if you’re considering buying or adopt a dog of the breed.</dd>
